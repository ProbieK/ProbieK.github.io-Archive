Hey Everyone!

So, now that you've seen my obligatory "[Hello World](/posts/hello-world/)" post , I figured I'd go into a little more detail about what I hope this blog will become.

I rarely ever post anything on social media, but I'm a frequent scroller. And all too often while I'm scrolling, I'll see posts from people saying something like "I've been hacked! Please don't click on any messages I've sent you or accept any friend requests!". Seriously, at least two or three times per week someone in my social media sphere is getting hacked/phished/spoofed or something. Additionally, almost none of these victims seem to know how they were hacked, why they were hacked, or how to secure their accounts (either reactively or proactively). So, that's why I'm starting this blog. As an Information Security Professional myself, I hope to shed some light on why and how these hacks takes place, and also how you can prevent these types of attacks from being successful against you; all the while keeping things interesting, easy to understand, and follow.

Some of the first topics that I plan on covering include:
* Phishing
* Password Security
* Multifactor Authentication
* Computer Security Best Practices

If you have any ideas for topics that you'd like me to cover, please leave me a comment on Facebook or Twitter and I'll be sure to cover it in a future post!
